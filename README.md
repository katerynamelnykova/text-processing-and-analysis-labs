# Text processing and text analysis labs

This repository contains eight laboratory assignments focused on various aspects of text processing and analysis. Each lab explores different methods and tools used in natural language processing (NLP), from text preprocessing to advanced techniques such as topic modeling and word embeddings.

## Labs Overview

### **Lab 1: Text Preprocessing**

This lab covers fundamental text preprocessing techniques. The key tasks include:
- Converting text to lowercase.
- Removing punctuation and special characters.
- Constructing regular expressions to match patterns in text.

### **Lab 2: Tokenization**

In this lab the focus is on:

- Extracting useful information from unstructured text data.
- Handling and cleaning text using pattern-based methods.
- Tokenizing text into words.
- Filtering out stopwords.

### **Lab 3: Text Vectorization and Similarity**

The tasks include:
- Creating Bag of Words (BoW) models.
- Implementing Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).
- Calculating text similarity using cosine similarity and Euclidean distance.

### **Lab 6: Sentiment Analysis**

This lab explores sentiment analysis using machine learning approaches. The main tasks include:
- Vectorizing the text using the TF-IDF technique.
- Training a logistic regression model on the vectorized data to classify the reviews.
- Evaluating the logistic regression model using a confusion matrix and accuracy score.
- Performing sentiment analysis using TextBlob's rule-based sentiment evaluation.
- Comparing the performance of both methods and displaying sample sentiment evaluations from random reviews.

### **Lab 7: Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Text Classification**

The main tasks include:
- Adding the "MOVIE" label to the NER component of the model.
- Training the model with several examples of sentences containing movie names.
- Saving the updated model to disk after training.
- Creating a new blank spaCy model and adding a TextCategorizer pipe to the pipeline with two labels: "FindMovies" and "AnotherTopic".
- Training the text classifier
